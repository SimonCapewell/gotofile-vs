Visual Studio extension for quickly jumping to a file in the solution

This is a fork of the [Open Now!](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=56) Visual Studio extension by Ryan Gregg ([Visual Studio Marketplace link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nem.OpenNow)).  Open Now! stopped working with Visual Studio 2019, and isn't very actively maintained, so I decided to make my own copy so I could tweak it to my heart's content.

Features:
* Open files in Visual Studio or view them in Windows Explorer.
* Force open files in code view (instead of designer view which some file types default to).
* Filter and sort by file name, file path, project name and project path.
* Filter using wildcards.
* Retain settings between uses.
* Fast responsive interface.
* Open source.
